	This shouldn't have been named with "AX" in the prefix: turns out having this on is a
	pre-requisite for FFlagUseLoadableImageForAvatarThumbnails, which affects things outside of
	AX.
	This pre-req meant we had to relocate this from from AX to here.  At this point I don't want to
	rename the flag because it's already been checked in.  So just leaving it as-is.
